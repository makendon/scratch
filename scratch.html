    <p>I haven't spent loads of time on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"><b>Scratch</b></a> but it was fun to make up some quick projects.
        The graphical approach lets you see the code and the order in which the instructions are carried out, which is nice for a beginner.
        The tutorials and shared projects on the Scratch website make it easy to get some ideas and get started.
        I also recommend checking out <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/scratch/2024/">CS50's Introduction to Programming with Scratch</a>.
